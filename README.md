# Devin Azzie Personal Profile Website - DevOps901.github.io

## Description 
A project was given to us to develop a website which will act as a personal profile/digital CV. Tasks were assigned each day and the project had to be live by day's end.

## Requirements
Day 1 had us initially create a header for our page which included our name, a picture of us and then links to our Gthub page and LinkedIn accounts. 

Day 2 we had to add an about me section as well as a significant projects section

Day 3 we were tasked with adding in an education/certification section

Day 4 we had to add an "" section to the site.
